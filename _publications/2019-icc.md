## Abstract 
This paper addresses the problem of exploring a region using the Hilbert's space-filling curve in the presence of obstacles. No prior knowledge of the region being explored is assumed. An online algorithm is proposed which can implement evasive strategies to avoid obstacles comprising a single or two blocked unit squares placed side by side and successfully explore the entire region. The strategies are specified by the change in the waypoint array which robot going to follow. The fractal nature of the Hilbert's space-filling curve has been exploited in proving the validity of the solution.
