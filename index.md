Hello, I am a third year PhD student in the [Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering](http://mechanical.illinois.edu/) (MechSE) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) (UIUC) being advised by [Prof. Prashant Mehta](http://mehta.mechse.illinois.edu/). 

<!--To know more about my past and current research, visit this <a href="{{ '/research/' | relative_url }}"> page</a>. -->

To see a list of my publications, visit this <a href="{{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}"> page</a> .

I received my <a href="#education-and-experience"> undergraduate degree </a> at the <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a>. 
<!--
During my time at IIT Bombay, I have been a part of the <a href="https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/satlab/">Student Satellite Project</a> and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cds.srg/">Controls and Dynamical Systems Student Reading Group </a>.
-->

Among other things, I enjoy listening to music (Steven Wilson and Anathema are two of my favourites), and indulge in photography and painting. I am an avid reader as well.
I have written (or rather, scribbled) about a few of my experiences <a href="{{ '/writing/' | relative_url }}"> here</a>. 

<!-- I may also write about some more academically or technically oriented topics in the future. -->
